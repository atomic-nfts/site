Atomic NFTs make it possible to sign and own pieces of the public decentralized data commons. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

To see some Atomic Content in action, you can get the [Koii Finnie Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/finnie/cjmkndjhnagcfbpiemnkdpomccnjblmj) or browse some content from the community on the [koi.rocks attention leaderboard](https://koi.rocks/).

## Why use Atomic NFTs?
- Storage Networks like [Arweave](https://arweave.org) have much lower gas fees
- Much less energy is used, and utilities can be added with [Gradual Consensus](https://koii.network/gradual-consensus.pdf)
- Media files can never be separated from the contracts that control their ownership
- All content receives KOII tokens any time it is viewed ([Learn More](https://koii.network/lightpaper.pdf))
