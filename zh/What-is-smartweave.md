# What is Smartweave?

<br>
SmartWeave is an approach to smart contracts that allows the blockchain to dispense with gas fees by only requiring a smart contract’s code to be run as often as it is needed. This greatly increases efficiency as the code does not need to be run by every node on the network.

Arweave Founder Sam Williams describes “SmartWeave as “a new smart contract language environment built on top of the Arweave network” he went on to explain that “it uses this novel type of evaluation called ‘lazy evaluation’ to move the computational burden of smart-contract execution from the nodes in the network to the users of the smart contract.”
