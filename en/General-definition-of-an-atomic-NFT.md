# General definition of an atomic NFT

## What is an Atomic NFT?

{: .fs-9 }

An Atomic NFT is a standard for Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) where the media assets and contract metadata are stored together immutably under a single unique identifier.

Anyone can use the Atomic NFT standard to tokenize and create digital assets to buy, sell, and auction through a marketplace.

The Koii Network facilitates a range of services associated with Atomic NFTs by default, and most of these are commission-lite or commission-free. By adopting the Atomic NFT standard, NFTs become interchangeable in all compatible applications. This makes it possible to create bridges to other chains and formats like Ethereum (and EVM), Tezos, Polkadot etc.
