## What is an Atomic NFT?
{: .fs-9 }

Atomic NFT is a standard for Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on Koii. 

Anyone can utilize the Atomic NFT standard to tokenize and create digital assets and buy, sell & auction assets utilizing the marketplace. 

The Koii Network facilitates a range of services associated with Atomic NFTs by default, and most of these are commission-lite or commission-free. Because Atomic NFTs all follow a common standard, they are interchangable between all compatible applications, as well as bridges to other chains and formats like Ethereum (and EVM), Tezos, and Polkadot.
